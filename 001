# Hello everyone, I'm physicist student at Istanbul University
# This tutorial belong our lectures and study  notes
# I hope, anyone who wants to learn programming with python can benefit from this tutorial

# Firstly, maybe you dont know what can you do in python,
# Don't woory you learning to step by step what can you in python like a definition and sloving to problem with using
# programming
# you developing your algorithmic and analytical thinking skills by working on programming, doesnt matter which one is
# it,
# This idea if of course for those who are new starting and don't knw what to do.


"""
programming basically working on variables and values.
so getting started with problem solving, you need to break its problem down into step by step and assign job descriptions
and variables.
so we start to variables and values.
The variables definiton on math ("https://mathinsight.org/definition/variable") like that python variables logical,
because Python is designed around readability, English language and mathematics were used in its design.
its meaning to whatever you think you can write it on python compiler, python designed near to humanity focused thinking.


so the basically
x=5
the variable of "x" and the values of "5"
we will operate on this basic variable logic


# variable: unit that keeping a value from the data type
x_values=55
y_values=88
print(x_values+y_values)


ASSIGMENT OF VARİABLE
variable_name=values


NOTE THAT!!
a=50
b=35
a,b=b,a
print(a,b)
terminal output>>
35 50
!!Due to the dynamic nature of python, we can change values between variables very easily.


a=5
a=100
print(a)
terminal output>>
100
!! Due to the dynamic nature of python, assigning a new value to the same variable
Python configures itself according to the new value


NOTE THAT: PROGRAMMİNG LANGUAGE HAS A UNIQUE SYNTAX RULES
• The syntax in Python is international, so everyone follows the same standards
• Python is case-sensitive, which means, for example, Name and name have different meanings
• The standard is to use English names in programming
• All variables should start with a lowercase letter, for example,  var = 4
• Functions begin with lowercase
• Classes begins with a capital letter
[https://code-knowledge.com/python-syntax-and-rules/]


YOU DON'T WRITE:
5value=88
value of values =55
?value=55
*=55
yo can't begining the value names or anywhere to the special characters
"""
# x y=55
# x%yuz=55
# print(x&yuz)
# >>SyntaxError: invalid character
""""

# NOTE THAT
# 3+4=a
# print(a)
# wrong assigment because the variable must be left side its a logical side from the math equation

SQUARE AREA
in math
area=(length)²
in python
length=5
area=length**2
print(area)
"""

# length=int(input(" give a number "))
# area=length*length
# print(area)

# TRIANGLE AREA
# first_length=int(input("first length="))
# height=int(input("height="))
# area=(first_length * height)/2
# print("area=", area)

# CIRCLE AREA
# radius=int(input("radius="))
# pi=3.14
# area=pi*radius**2
# print("area=",area)

"""
NOTE THAT: CHANGE A VARIABLE VALUE WITH ITSELF
a=5
a=a+5
print(a)
>>> 10

a+=5 Adding/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division  to the value of a
a-=2
a*=6
a/=8

This was the first note of our tutoril.
I am open to talk about different and effective writing techniques in my work.
this consists of my study notes rather than a subjective study, I will share my sources with you.
